## Hello!

I am Aaditya, but most people call me Aadi. I am a senior at Yale-NUS College (YNC), where I am majoring in Mathematical, Computational & Statistical Sciences (MCS). 

My coding journey began when I was 15. I coded a bunch of [2D arcade games](https://github.com/T-RektGames) using different game engines and published them on the Play Store. Since then, I have explored a variety of technologies and frameworks through personal projects and internships. My current interest lies in server-side development.

I have also held leadership positions in many different clubs that aim to spread the Makers culture. Most notably, I was the president of Yale-NUS College Hacks from 2021 to 2022, during which I organised workshops and projects that provided members with technical skills such as HTML and 3D printing.

Apart from coding, I am also passionate about animal welfare causes, which has motivated me to volunteer in a local dog shelter, as well as foster 2 cats.
