## Hello!

<img width="800" src="https://github.com/knowyourenemy/personal_website/blob/master/src/assets/images/screenshots/home-landscape.png" alt="Website home page    landscape">

I am Aaditya, but most people call me Aadi. I am a sophomore at Yale-NUS College (YNC), where I plan to major in Mathematical, Computational & Statistical Sciences (MCS). 

The projects I have worked on include simple 2d arcade games I made using the LibGDX and Unity game engines, as well as a personal website using React.js.

I believe that every person can benefit from the joy of building things, whether it is hardware, software, for commercial purposes, or just for fun. In YNC, I am currently the chairman of YNC_Hacks, which aims to spread the makers culture in the liberal arts environment of the college.

In my free time, I like to play the electric guitar, and volunteer at a dog shelter in Singapore.

I am always open to new opportunities! Feel free to contact me at aadipatwari@gmail.com or visit https://www.aadipatwari.com if you would like to find out more about me.
