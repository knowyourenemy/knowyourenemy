## Hello!

I am a senior at Yale-NUS College (YNC), where I am majoring in Mathematical, Computational & Statistical Sciences (MCS). 

My coding journey began when I was 15. I coded a bunch of [2D arcade games](https://github.com/T-RektGames) using different game engines and published them on the Play Store. Since then, I have explored a variety of technologies and frameworks through personal projects and internships. My current interest lies in server-side development.

Apart from coding, I am also passionate about animal welfare causes, which has motivated me to volunteer in a local dog shelter, foster 2 cats, as well as create [this website](https://catsofsg.com) for cats in Singapore.

Feel free to contact me at aadipatwari@gmail.com or visit my personal website at https://www.aadipatwari.com.
