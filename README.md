## Hello!

<img width="800" src="https://github.com/knowyourenemy/personal_website/blob/master/src/assets/images/screenshots/home-landscape.png" alt="Website home page    landscape">

I am Aaditya, but most people call me Aadi. I am a junior at Yale-NUS College (YNC), where I am majoring in Mathematical, Computational & Statistical Sciences (MCS). 

My coding journey began when I was 15. I coded a bunch of [2D arcade games](https://github.com/T-RektGames) using different game engines and published them on the Play Store. Since then, I have explored a variety of technologies and frameworks through personal projects and internships, including React JS, Django, and most recently, Express JS. My current interest lies in server-side development.

I have also held leadership positions in many different clubs that aim to spread the Makers culture. Most notably, I was the president of Yale-NUS College Hacks from 2021 to 2022, during which I organised workshops and projects that provided members with technical skills such as HTML and 3D printing.

Apart from coding, I am also passionate about animal welfare causes, which has driven me to volunteer in a local dog shelter, as well as foster 2 cats. I also run an [online aroid boutique](https://ploont.sg) with some friends.
